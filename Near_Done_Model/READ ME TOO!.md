Welcome to the database folder! Inside here you will find several Excel sheets and database files!

There are three main types of databases which were inputted into the program:
The training building set, which included information about buildings in past earthquakes, 
The Israel building set, which was used to produce the results tables found in the parent folder,
And the defense dictionary! Which was created to help the program translate things like "defense level 'wood'" into numerical representations of defense levels!

All of these databases were compiled by hand, and took very. very. long. But they turned out effective!

Additionally, you may notice that there are both csv and db files here, this is because I preffered to code in SQL rather than manipulate Excel files in Python,
so my program began by creating SQL databases (db) for the training sets.

I also left in some of the prototype training sets, which attempted to remove possible outliers, and the final trainning set ("Near Complete Model.csv")

P.S. Even though it says near everywhere, this is the final product! I was on a large time crunch and didn't have too much of a chance to cleanup the naming conventions!
