Hello there! Welcome to my project!

Just to give a bit of clarification about what you are looking at here:

In this folder you will find a folder called "Near_Done_Model," despite its name, this folder stores the completed databases used for the final product, and a couple extra databases used in testing. (To see more, check READ ME file in folder)

You will also find here, a python file called "Earthquake Impact Predictor," This is the full code, the most important part of the project!
I have included comments within the code to supply as much clarification as I could, but the code projects the full process of my journey through the project and has some commented out vestiges. 
I would recommend looking at my ProjectBoard submission before the python file, just for some background! (https://projectboard.world/ysc/project/an-earthshattering-coding-prophecy)

And finally, you will find the two results table which the program produced, one representing the results of K-Nearest Neighbors Classification, and the other of Logistic Regression. 

I have also included my project report, which is structured as a lab, and was submitted as the main presentation of my project to the Regional Science Fair. 
It includes everything you would need to understand the project.
Highly recommned to read!
